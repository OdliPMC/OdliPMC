- 👋 Hi, I’m @OdliPMC
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science, Web Dev, and AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CS50x both on Computer Science and Python!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of the moment, I'm kinda still new to the prospect of coding and programming as a whole.
- 📫 How to reach me : odliplamenco@gmail.com, @lokiraccz on Discord, and OdliPMC on Facebook!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a college student and I really don't know what I'm doing :3
